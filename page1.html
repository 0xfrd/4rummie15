        <h1>Untitled #1</h1>
        <p>

            Hey Rummie,
    
            I hope this letter finds you well.
            
            I am writing to you because I think about you a lot. The things that I would text you about, I will write here, along with thoughts and feelings that I have. I guess this will be my journal. Should I be sending it to you when the subject of almost all my thoughts is you? I don't know when you will get this; I don't know. 
            
            I'm watching this football match right now between Manchester City and Liverpool, lying in my bed. Even football doesn't seem enjoyable anymore. Nothing does. Not even Red Dead Redemption. I played it today, John finally got to know where Dutch is hiding. He killed Bill Williamson and Javier Escuella back in Mexico, now John has to find Dutch if he wants to see his wife and son. Dutch has been hiding out with a group of Native Americans, inciting them against the white people, leading them to believe in his "idea." "You always were a fine speaker," John said to Dutch. John also found Sam's dead body. You know the guy who wanted to get to California? He also found a letter in his pockets, to his wife stating how he had left due to some dream of his father's and his father's before him. He ends the letter saying how he has made a terrible mistake but now it's too late to turn back.
            
            My dad just brought a lit coil into my room and I instantly thought of you and how you're sternly against coils. 
            
            It's incredibly difficult to not be with the person who you love. Love is a difficult, terrible, beautiful thing but there's always that risk as you yourself said to me. I can't forget our last call. I don't think I said all that I wanted to say. But how could I? In so little time to be able to put all my feelings, hopes, and dreams with you into words is an impossible task. So many things I want to do with you, so many things I want to experience. We didn't ever go on a trip together. We didn't ever spend time till 2 AM in the morning together in person. But for some reason, these things don't hurt as much as the little things. I heard this Adele song on a Facebook reel yesterday. If you're wondering why I am watching reels on Facebook, it's because I cannot bring myself to open Instagram. The song was Rolling in the Deep by Adele and I immediately closed the reel and the app. And I thought about why I never listened to her songs with you, why I never had more watch2gethers with you.
            
            Have to give it time.
            
            I just saw a TikTok story you posted, "me projecting my entire personality into a soulless vacuum of a man and proceeding to fall in love w him instead of loving myself in the first place." I can't help but think that that story was about me. Maybe you posted it just because it made you laugh. I don't know. It hurts not knowing which one it is. But maybe I deserve that, maybe I am that kind of soulless, vacuum of a person. i texted you asking but I unsent it. 
            
            Even watching a football match is the little thing that I wanted to do with you. I wanted to watch the final of the Champions League with you. I don't think I will be able to let these little things go, I can't let go of the hope that I have that I will get to do all these things with you.
            
            Look at these people on Facebook, on LDF, posting memes, laughing and laugh reacting to posts. And here we are, going through what we're going through. This girl texted me this morning from my TA-ship class, panicking about her submission. She had submitted a document but in the submissions tab on LMS, her submission was not showing. It showed as if her submission was empty. She even emailed ma'am about this in the span of like 20 minutes. As soon as I saw her texts, I checked and told her that her submission was submitted fine. She asked me that she had emailed the instructor and would that be a problem now? I told her no, it's alright. And I felt a strange feeling of good-ness. I had helped this person and removed their anxiety and despite going through an unspeakable feeling of anxiety and pain and dread myself, I still felt that strange feeling of good-ness. I guess no matter what one is going through, if they still manage to take out time to help others it becomes very very very slightly better, no matter how infinitesimally little that may be, it still feels a little nice.
            
            You said something on our call that I have been thinking about. We were talking about forgiveness and you said that you can't forgive people and let them get away with what they are doing to you, if you do that then there's something wrong with you. I disagree with you. Forgiveness is important, especially for those whom you hold close, whom you hold dear to your heart. Referring to what we were talking about on the call in the context of forgiveness, I didn't think twice about forgiving you for telling me to shut up. I did that because there is so much love for you in my heart. This is not a bad thing. You might think that if a person does forgive then they are essentially allowing the other person to get away with anything. I believe that one of the fundamental things that love is based upon is forgiveness. Of course, no one would forgive another person if they go to some extreme such as abuse, but for the other more um - for the lack of a better word - human things, such as gussa, irritation, and feelings of overwhelm, I believe that love itself derives out of forgiveness in these moments. To not forgive such moments would be somewhat similar to not forgiving the other person for just being human. I believe that people should forgive, but only when they know that the other person feels bad about what they said or did. I knew instantly that you would've been feeling bad about telling me to shut up. I knew that. And as a result, I started regretting reacting to it the way I did by hanging up the call.
            
            Have to give it time, must give it time.
            
            I don't know what to feel. The day passed, and I don't remember anything. It just came and went. I don't know what you're feeling at this moment. How your days are passing, what you're going through. I saw your stories, you were out today. That's good, some distraction is always nice. It's suffocating not knowing how you're doing. I know you're probably sad. Not being there to listen and comfort you is difficult. I wish I could text you right now and ask, I wish in reply you'd tell me all about your feelings, I wish I could say come here and hold you in my arms, caress your head and give you so many kisses. I can't imagine what you're going through. To have such love for someone like you have for me and then see them hurt you like I did... god. I am sorry. I have no words. I wish I could make you alright.
            
            I went out yesterday too, to meet with Balaj in Bahria. I met with him and he asked about you. I didn't have the heart to tell him what had happened. I just nodded and agreed and said that you're doing good. I just wanted to get out of there, go home and hide in my room. The anxiety that I started feeling at that moment was immense; I decided it'd probably be for the best if I just stayed home and didn't meet with anyone.
            
            I haven't been to the lab in a week. And to be honest, I don't have the energy to go tomorrow either. But I guess I have to show my face around the place so that they know I haven't disappeared. That's what I have to do tomorrow. Maybe go to the lab first, and then go to class? I guess that'll be best. I'm dreading having to sit in that class without having the comfort of the thought that I will soon go back home to you, that I will get to talk to you. I will probably not meet with Taram either. I'm dreading tomorrow. I'm dreading every future second.
            
            Nothing is helping. The only thing that helps is what I keep repeating to myself: have to give it time.
            
            I am writing every word in this email with love for you. Is that creepy? Now that you've left? Is it inappropriate to say that I want to hold you in my arms and kiss you, your eyes, your tears that are being shed because of my own self in the first place? Is it wrong? I don't know. I guess you would say that this is my reality, so it is okay. But is it the same for you anymore? I can't bring myself to even think that you would answer that question in the negative, even if I know that that is likely the case.
            
            I don't want you to think that all this makes you a bad person. I saw your story the other day in which you had posted a TikTok which said something along the lines of: "me after acting out but it was because of something they did." And that is right. None of your actions have been unreasonable or unjustifiable. They are as solid as stone. Any one put into your position would do the same.
            
            I don't know what you're feeling. I don't know anything about how you are. And it's killing me. I just wish you're having at least some moments that make you forget about what is happening, in a joyful, good way.
            
            I'm nearing the end of Red Dead Redemption. It just feels empty without you. John got back to his family at his ranch and he and his son went to buy some cattle from the MacFarlanes. As soon as they met Bonnie, my eyes welled up with tears.
            
            It's almost the full moon, and I can't see it. I wish you were here.
            
            I wish I could see the heart on your cheek again. 
            
            There was a yellow lollipop in the door of my car that you had picked out. I keep it in the pocket of my jacket now.
            
            I have your chat pinned on my WhatsApp. I keep my phone close, on vibrate, in hopes that you will text me eventually. Whenever it vibrates, my ears prick up like a dog and I go to check it, only to be disappointed. 
            
            I texted the creepy guy at the lab for an update. We had discussed with sir that we need someone's google account with access to Google Earth Engine and billing enabled so that we can extract the data required for our research project from the satellites in orbit around the Earth. He was going to ask some people abroad for it so I texted him, asking for an update. I kind of lucked out as he said he had been home for the week and will get back this week. So I will meet with him then and discuss what to do next.
            
            Have to give it time.
            
            Nothing interesting happened today. Days are passing with no word from you. It feels like there is no light left. 
            
            Time. There are times when you want to get on your knees and beg the gods of clock to stop the needle, to preserve the moment, transfer it into your computer, make a folder of a thousand, a million, copies of it, just so you can print them and travel into them whenever you want to for the rest of your life. I have had so many moments like that with you when I had wished for time to stop. But it doesn't. Then there are times when you wish for time to never stop, in fact, you want the clock to run down over and over a thousand times before the word "time" ever leaves your lips. Right now is such a time. But it doesn't. At least the clock turns, however slow it may be. Guess I can't complain too much.
            
            I saw Portrait of a Lady on Fire the other day. Incredible film. Beautifully shot, and a beautifully tragic story as well. Not just the main plot, but the subplot with Sophie and her pregnancy was tragic as well. I loved how when they go to this woman and she conducts the abortion (?) and there is this baby on the bed who starts playing with Sophie. What a fucking film. I loved how it's never talked about in the movie who the father of the child is because it's not important at all, it's not what it is about. I loved how even the subplot carries the themes of the movie forward, women dealing with consequences of, well, just being women. I loved all three of them. When she sees the painting of Heloise many years later with the book in her hand, finger on the page 28, I teared up. When she sees her for the last time at the opera, and it's the music that Marianne had played for her on the piano. I loved it. There is a scene in the movie when she paints the first portrait of Heloise and she asks her if that was the way she saw her. Marianne explains how one's presence is made up of these fleeting things. Heloise replies that not everything is fleeting, some feelings are deep. That reminded me of the thing that I talked with you about on call. You had said that feelings are temporary. And I don't know about that. Sure, things get less impactful with time. But would it be fair to say even that when what we feel is the very thing that shapes and drives us? I don't know. I guess what I am trying to say is, I feel like it's a disservice to ourselves when we say that feelings are just temporary. They aren't. They are a huge part of who we are, of who we will become. The wound heals, but the scar remains. But some wounds are deep, and some scars perpetual.
            
            I am sorry. Words cannot begin to describe how sorry I am for everything. For hurting you, for splitting your heart. For the insensitive and inconsiderate "jokes", for not getting you flowers, for having called you names, for not telling you about the talking stages when we first started dating, for not doing the little things, for not giving you enough time and space, for not meeting you on your birthday, for not saying "I understand, I'm sorry you had to go through that" every time you told me something about yourself, for not telling you enough how much I love you, for not giving you the gifts that I have kept for you, for not meeting you enough, for keeping little things from you for no reason at all, for everything. I am sorry. I wish I could take back my words, I wish I could undo my actions.
            
            I love you. I love you so much. I do.
            
            There is not one single flaw about you. You are perfect in every way. On our call, you kept saying how I could find someone else like you, how I could go on a bookshop romance or something. But you don't understand. And that's okay because you have never seen yourself from my eyes. There are reels on instagram that I have also often sent to you describing how everyone else is just the same, part of a crowd, unremarkable and forgettable, how everyone else is imperfect and flawed. But there is that one person who stands out from the rest, who is perfect, flawless with all their perfect little imperfections, who has a constant natural spotlight shone onto them at all times that only one person can see. For me, that person is you. There is no one prettier than you, smarter than you, more intelligent than you, more caring than you, more loving than you, kinder than you, gentler than you, sweeter than you, more articulate than you, more perfect than you. There is no one better than you. There is just no other you. You are unique in so many brilliant ways that it boggles my mind. And I love that about you. I love how your brain works, I love how you think, I love how you speak, I love your eyes, I love your smile, I love your cheeks, I love all your little subconscious and unconscious mannerisms. I love you, your existence, your idea, your identity, your name, your voice, your gender (all/both of them and/or the lack thereof), everything, everything that makes you you.
            
            When I was little, "Hamd" used to be a part of every Urdu textbook in every grade that I studied. Sometimes it was presented as Urdu prose, and sometimes it was a poem. One thing to note here is that I used to study Urdu from these guides because there were always these khulasas, tashreehs, mehfooms, and whatnot. Every time Hamd was part of the Urdu syllabus, whether in the form of prose or poem, it's khulasa or tashreeh would talk about the majesty of god and how his magnificence could not be described at all. I remember one line distinctly:
            
            اگرآپ خدا کی تعاریف بیان کرنا شروع بہی کریں تو سیاہی کے سمندر ختم ہوجائیں مگر اس کی تعاریف زرا بہی بیان نہیں ہو سکے گی
            
            And that is kind of how I feel about you. You put me at a loss for words. It's also kind of fitting as for me, your silence has been like the silence of god.
            
            Whenever I hear any Coldplay song, I think of you and I. Us, conquering the world together. Or something. I know you don't really like Coldplay that much, but when I hear their songs, yellow, a sky full of stars, viva la vida, paradise, magic, I can't help but think of you. I think that's love.
            
            It has been all gray skies for the past few days. It feels like an eternity has passed with these gray skies above. But they are finally clearing up now. I cannot stop myself from taking that as a sign of something. 
            
            I have also attached a presentation with this email. I have never been good at making presentations, much less presenting. I always get anxious, panic, lose my train of thought, and get scared. But I have tried my best with this one. I wish I could have presented it to you in person, but the slides themselves will have to suffice. I have worked on it hard, and I hope it gives you something to think about. The Address slide is a lot shorter than I wanted it to be. The point of that is that I know that I have hurt you. It hurts so much to be hurt by someone you love. I'm sorry that I put you in that position in the first place. To have your heart split, to be disappointed in the person that you love over how they are with you... My apologies and words cannot make up for it. But I know that I can.
            
            I could write on and on in this email till eternity. But I also want you to read it. I'm going to stop, at least for the time being.
            
            I got to the end of Red Dead Redemption. Bonnie developed feelings for John, even though she doesn't ever tell, it's confirmed as she looks as John and his wife Abigail longingly after seeing them for the last time and Abigail mentions that to John as well that she got all red upon seeing him. In the end, the government agents raid John and his family's ranch and shoot him down. He sends his wife and son off to safety on a horse and stays behind in the barn alone to face the army of soldiers and agents outside. He opens the barn doors and comes out guns blazing, shooting as many agents as he can but there are just too many and they gun him down. His wife and son bury him under a tree and then there is this beautiful shot of his grave and the camera slowly gets back revealing his son, Jack, all grown up now and looking at his grave. Then the camera moves a little to the right and we see that he has buried his mother right next to John. Jack then goes after the agent, Edgar Ross, who killed John and kills him in a duel. Jack ends up becoming what John tried his best to prevent him from becoming. Such a brilliant, tragic, tragic tale. I wish you could have seen it through with me.
            
            I'm scared of sending this out.
            
            Thinking of you, and missing you dearly.
            
            I love you.
            
            Sincerely yours,
            Farid.</p>
